Description: 
    This Omero script allows the user to obtain the filenames of the images in Omero dataset(s).
    After running this script, a csv file of the filenames of the images in the dataset(s) will appear in the corresponding dataset(s) under the "Attachments" section. 
    The csv file has the filename "<dataset-name>_filenames.csv"

    NOTE: This script can only be ran in the Omero Script UI under the custom_scripts tab

    INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DEPLOY THIS SCRIPT:
        1. Make sure that the script is mounted to the Omero server scripts directory in the Docker container
            Add this bind mount to the volumes section in the docker compose file that is creating the Omero server Docker container
            "<path-to-directory-with-script-in-host-server>:/opt/omero/server/OMERO.server/lib/scripts/omero/custom_scripts:ro"
        2. Restart the Docker containers
        3. When you are logged in to the Omero website, you should see the gears icon on the top right corner of the interface (close to the search bar). Click on the icon and you should see a "custom_scripts" tab if done correctly
    INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT:
        1. When you are logged in to the website, you should see the gears icon on the top right corner of the interface (close to the search bar). Click on the icon.
        2. Select "custom_scripts"
        3. Select "Get Filenames From Datasets". The interface for the script should appear.
        4. Enter the ID(s) of the dataset(s) where you want to retrieve the filenames of the images, separated by a comma (only needed if you are doing this for multiple datasets). There is a shortcut where you can select the dataset(s) before clicking on the gears icon, which will fill in the IDs entry without you having to enter the IDs yourself.
        5. Click "Run Script" once you have the dataset ID(s) entered
        6. After the script finishes running, you should see a "done" message.
        7. Click on the dataset and look at the "Attachments" tab, where you should see the csv file generated with the filenames. The file is usually called "<dataset_name>_filenames.csv"
